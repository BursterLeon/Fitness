**Project Name: Fitness Tracker Application**

**Overview**

The Fitness Tracker App is a simple application designed to help users set health goals, calculate their calories, and keep track of their workout progress. Users can create an account, set their fitness goals,
 track how much calories they consume and burn, and perform various exercises to achieve their goals in a user-friendly interface.

**Design**

The project consists of several classes to function properly and take care of different parts of the system:

**1. Main Class:** Manages user interaction, helps user create their account, and gives them the option to track their calorie goals or start their workout.

**2. Trainer Class:** Represents a fitness trainer.  The trainers individually specialize in a specific goal such as losing weight or gaining muscle.  These could include exercises
such as cardio or strength training.

**3. Customer Class:** Represents the user of the app.  Stores the users' personal information and fitness goals.

**4. UserInputHandler Class:** Handles user input.  Prompts user to provide their personal information including their name, age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and fitness goal.

**5. CaloriesInputHandler Class:** Handles user input for calories consumed and burned during workouts.

**6. CalorieTracker Class:** Keeps track of calories consumed, burned, and logs the user's overall progress in achieving their fitness goal.

**7. Exercise Class:** Represents an exercise and stores information which consists of the name, target muscle group, and calories burned per minute.

**8. Workout Class:** Manages the list of exercises executed in a workout and calculates the calories burned during the workout.
